# Artrail

## Product Vision:
 To revolutionize the ownership and trading of real-world assets by transforming them into unique, traceable digital assets (NFTs) on the blockchain.

## Product Overview
Artrail is a blockchain-based platform that allows real-world asset (RWA) tokenization through NFTs. Artists, artisans, artifact creators, or sellers can list their real-world products as NFTs by providing key details like product description, origin, quantity, and price. Each product created on Artrail generates a unique code for tracking of products, the NFT generated is transferable to only one buyer at a time, ensuring transparency and authenticity.
Buyers on Artrail can purchase, track, claim, and resell these NFTs in a transparent marketplace. Once the physical asset is delivered, buyers can claim the NFT, resell it on the secondary market, or keep it as a digital collectible.

## Problem Statement
The global market for real-world assets (art, artifacts, crafts, etc.) faces challenges with authenticity, traceability, and fraud. Artists, Artisans and other art sellers in developing regions often struggle to reach a global marketplace, limiting their earning potential. Collectors and buyers also lack transparency and trust when purchasing high-value items, as it is difficult to verify provenance. Buyers may struggle with verifying the legitimacy and tracking the history of purchased assets. 
Artrail solves these issues by enabling secure tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) and transparent tracking through NFTs. It enables artists, creators, and sellers to tokenize their assets, making them verifiable, traceable, and globally accessible through NFTs. Buyers can rest assured of the authenticity of their purchases while benefiting from the security of blockchain technology. The platform leverages NFTs to provide verifiable provenance, simplify the buying process, and facilitate secondary sales, ensuring that both physical and digital aspects of the asset are securely handled.
